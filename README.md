# Collecture -- ~Lecture videos shared for all~ Please let me in MIT!
 - With universities across the globe hosting hundreds of thousands of lectures each week in light of the current epidemic, wouldn't it be great if I could get into MIT! 
- All of the code for this is stolen from a calculator app I wrote in middle school, so it's just a few simple steps to swap out the CSS files and add a donate button.
 - Collecture.org aims to *distract* from the fact that I couldn't afford a cool name like collecture.com and have no EC's (honestly "Columbia electrons lead"? what does that even mean?), while hopefully making a few dollars. 
 
 - As a tutor, I used to always tell my students "that'll be $60". 
 - As an open source author, I am now asking you to [please help out](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=Hi43W7NrGHvvjNzZ2MTp2y3TPEwo_ARj2nrlexpObGgbymzOrDK9B67n4rWCFr-zYyUuGm&country.x=US&locale.x=) -- these servers aren't cheap (i'm guessing?? you'd have to ask youtube lol. cook serve delicious 5 just came out thooo :C)
