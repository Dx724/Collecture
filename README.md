# [Collecture](https://collecture.org) -- Lecture videos shared for all
 - With universities across the globe hosting hundreds of thousands of lectures each week in light of the current epidemic, wouldn't it be great if we could preserve all of this knowledge being shared for decades to come?
 - Lectures are already recorded digitally, so it's only a few steps to get these videos online.
 - Collecture aims to *collect* these lectures in one place, tagged and organized so anyone can search and find exactly what they want.
